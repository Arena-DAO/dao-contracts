# Gauges

Forked from [Wynd DAO repo](https://github.com/wynddao/wynddao), modified to support any type of DAO.

## TODO
- [ ] More tests (consider refactoring with cw-orch)
- [ ] Make improvements to `GaugeAdapter` API
- [ ] Improve `GaugeAdapter` examples
- [ ] Does not handle small numbers elegantly (a problem with NFT DAOs, where people might stake 1 NFT)
- [ ] Better READMEs
