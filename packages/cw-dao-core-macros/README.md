# cw-dao-core Macros

This package contains a collection for macros for deriving query
fields for interacting with the DAO DAO contract interface. For more
information about this interface, and how contracts are expected to
interface with it see our [contracts design wiki
page](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/wiki/DAO-DAO-Contracts-Design).
